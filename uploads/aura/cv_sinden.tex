% Experienced scientist with a demonstrated history of developing product-level code and algorithms in close collaboration with business partners and end customers. Over 10 years of experience in the domain of external beam radiation therapy, developing automatic segmentation algorithms and advanced algorithms for plan optimization. Recent projects on anatomical mapping for cardiac electro-physiology as well as cone-beam reconstruction for c-arm systems. Over 20 years of experience using and developing statistical machine learning methods. I master C++, python, *nix, work agile, believe in test-driven development, CI/CD, and quickly learn tools that help improve efficiency. Basic knowledge in containerization, cuda, PyTorch. My interests are to work on developing machine learning methods in combination with (advanced) physical and mathematical modeling - together with friendly and collaborative colleagues.

% I have been researching methods in the field of medical imaging systems and their clinical application for more than 20 years. I focus on classical image processing, machine learning and data analysis. My strengths lie in my ability to quickly familiarize myself with related fields, to structure complex situations and to recognize connections between different disciplines. I find it easy to shape the dialog between scientists, IT developers and customers. This results in new perspectives and inn
