The talk begins with an introduction to AI, focusing on what different neural networks are, and what is necessary to train a network. With this knowledge, a small number of applications are presented, covering segmentation and registration, treatment planning and physics-informed neural networks, treatment monitoring and outcome prediction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence in Therapeutic Ultrasound</title><link>https://djps.github.io/talks/istu2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://djps.github.io/talks/istu2023/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This talk aims at briefly introducing some key concepts in artificial intelligence which are relevant to therapeutic ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was delivered as an educational session at
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a number of challenges in writing this, mainly relating to the breadth of the possible applications and, at the same time introducing a number of technical concepts which needed to be defined. Many of the subject areas could have been lecture courses in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abstract can be found &lt;a href="https://djps.github.io/abstracts/lyon/"&gt;[here]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slides will be uploaded soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
